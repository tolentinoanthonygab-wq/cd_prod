## 6.1 Name Generation

Student names are drawn independently from three pools in `data.py`:

- `FIRST_NAMES` â€” 119 entries, multicultural (English, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Indian, Filipino)
- `LAST_NAMES` â€” 96 entries, similarly multicultural with Filipino surnames weighted higher
- `MIDDLE_NAMES` â€” 54 entries

Each draw is independent and uniform:

```math
\text{first} \sim \text{Uniform}(\text{FIRST\_NAMES}), \quad \text{last} \sim \text{Uniform}(\text{LAST\_NAMES}), \quad \text{middle} \sim \text{Uniform}(\text{MIDDLE\_NAMES})
```

### Suffix Application

After the first name is drawn, a suffix may be stored in the `User.suffix` column:

```math
\text{suffix\_applied} = \begin{cases} \text{True} & \text{if } U(0,1) \leq p_\text{suffix} \\ \text{False} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
```


where `p_suffix` = `SEED_USER_SUFFIX_PROBABILITY` (default 0.3). If applied, a suffix is drawn uniformly from `["Jr.", "Sr.", "II", "III", "IV"]` and stored in `User.suffix`. The first name itself is left unmodified.

With the default probability, approximately 30% of students will have a non-null `suffix` column.

## 6.2 Email Generation

Student emails are derived deterministically from the generated name and school domain:

```
{first_name_part}.{last_name_part}{number}@{school_domain}
```

Where:
- `first_name_part` = first token of the first name, lowercased (handles suffixes like "Jr.")
- `last_name_part` = last token of the last name, lowercased (handles compound surnames like "Dela Cruz")
- `number`:
  ```math
  n \sim \text{Uniform}(1, 99)
  ```

Example: `james.smith42@aurauniversity.edu.ph`

This scheme can produce collisions. The seeder does not check for email uniqueness â€” the database `UNIQUE` constraint on `users.email` will raise an error if a collision occurs. In practice, with 119 first names Ã— 96 last names Ã— 99 number suffixes = 1,131,264 possible combinations, collisions are extremely rare at the scale the seeder operates at.

## 6.3 Student ID Generation

Student IDs follow the format `{year}-{5-digit-number}`:

```
{start_year}-{rng.randint(10000, 99999)}
```

Where `start_year` is the year component of `SEED_START_MMDDYY`.

The seeder maintains a `used_student_ids` set per school and retries until a unique ID is found:

```python
while True:
    sid = f"{start_date[2]}-{rng.randint(10000, 99999)}"
    if sid not in used_student_ids:
        used_student_ids.add(sid)
        break
```


The probability of needing a retry is:

```math
P(\text{collision on attempt } k) = \frac{k-1}{90000}
```

At 2,000 students, the expected number of retries is approximately:

```math
E[\text{retries}] = \sum_{k=1}^{2000} \frac{k-1}{90000} \approx \frac{2000 \times 1999}{2 \times 90000} \approx 22
```

This is negligible.

## 6.4 Password Hashing

### Uniform passwords

When `SEED_UNIQUE_PASSWORDS = False`, all students get the password `Student123!`. A single bcrypt hash is computed and reused for all students. This is fast.

### Unique passwords

When `SEED_UNIQUE_PASSWORDS = True`, a unique 12-character password is generated per student:

```python
pw = "".join(rng.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=10)) + "1!"
```

The `"1!"` suffix ensures the password meets the minimum complexity requirement (at least one digit, at least one special character).

All passwords are hashed in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```python
def hash_passwords_parallel(passwords, rounds=6, workers=10):
    def _hash(pw):
        return bcrypt.hashpw(pw.encode("utf-8"), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=rounds)).decode("utf-8")
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=workers) as executor:
        return list(executor.map(_hash, passwords))
```

The bcrypt cost factor is set to `rounds=6` for students (fast, suitable for demo data) and `rounds=12` for the platform admin (production-grade security).

### bcrypt cost comparison

The bcrypt work factor doubles with each increment:

```math
\text{time}(r) \approx 2^{r-6} \times \text{time}(6)
```

| rounds | Relative cost |
|--------|--------------|
| 6 | 1Ã— (baseline) |
| 8 | 4Ã— |
| 10 | 16Ã— |
| 12 | 64Ã— |

At `rounds=6` with 10 parallel workers, hashing 2,000 passwords takes approximately 2â€“5 seconds depending on hardware. At `rounds=12`, the same operation would take 128â€“320 seconds â€” which is why the seeder uses `rounds=6` for bulk student generation.

## 6.5 Program Assignment and Enrollment Skew

Students are not distributed uniformly across programs. Before student generation begins, each program in the school's program pool is assigned a random weight:

```math
w_i \sim \text{Uniform}(10, 100), \quad i \in \{1, \ldots, |\text{program\_pool}|\}
```

Students are then assigned via weighted sampling with replacement:

```math
P(\text{student assigned to program } i) = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j} w_j}
```

This produces realistic enrollment skew. In a school with 5 programs, one program might have weight 95 and another weight 12, resulting in roughly 8Ã— more students in the popular program.

The weights are drawn once per school and reused for all students in that school. This means the enrollment distribution is consistent within a school but varies between schools.

---

## 6.6 Campus Admin

Each school gets exactly one campus admin user:

- Email: `admin@{school_domain}`
- Password: `CampusAdmin123!` (hashed at `rounds=6`)
- Role: `campus_admin`

The campus admin is created with get-or-create semantics â€” if a user with that email already exists, it is reused.
