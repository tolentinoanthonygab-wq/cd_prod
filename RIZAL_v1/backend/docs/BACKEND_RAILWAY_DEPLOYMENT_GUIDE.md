The repository now keeps a single compose file (`docker-compose.yml`). This page documents the constrained-platform variant for services such as Railway where you may still need a single backend container to host the web process plus optional worker sidecars.

## Current Runtime Behavior

`Backend/scripts/run_runtime_stack.py` now:

1. creates import and school-logo storage directories from `Backend/app/core/config.py`
2. optionally runs `alembic upgrade heads` when `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START=true`
3. optionally launches Celery worker and beat sidecars
4. starts `uvicorn`

Important change:

- automatic demo seeding is no longer supported in the runtime stack
- `RUN_SEED_ON_START` is obsolete
- production bootstrap must be run explicitly with `python Backend/bootstrap.py ...`

## Recommended Platform Variables

- `DATABASE_URL=<managed postgres url>`
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL=<managed redis url>`
- `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=<managed redis url>`
- `SECRET_KEY=<strong secret>`
- `LOGIN_URL=<public frontend url>`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<public frontend origins>`
- `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=disabled` or `mailjet_api`
- `MAILJET_API_KEY=<mailjet key>` when email is enabled
- `MAILJET_API_SECRET=<mailjet secret>` when email is enabled
- `UVICORN_WORKERS=1`
- `CELERY_WORKER_POOL=solo`
- `CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=1`

Non-secret runtime defaults such as face warm-up and import limits now come from `Backend/app/core/app_settings.py`.

## Suggested Release Flow

1. Run migrations:
   - `alembic upgrade heads`
2. Run the one-time bootstrap:
   - `python Backend/bootstrap.py --admin-email admin@example.com --admin-password ChangeMe123!`
3. Start the web process.
4. Start worker and beat as separate processes or sidecars if the platform allows it.

## How to Test

1. Deploy with `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=disabled`.
2. Confirm startup logs show the API booted without trying to auto-seed.
3. Run the bootstrap command once.
4. Verify the admin can log in and that no demo schools or sample users were created.
5. If Mailjet is enabled, confirm the backend startup logs show successful Mailjet connectivity verification.
